THEY SAY "JIM ACOSTA, THE REASON WE DID WHAT WE DID IS BECAUSE WE DO NOT LIKE YOU, HERE IS YOUR NOTICE, HERE IS YOUR HEARING, YOU HAVE TO CONTEST THAT, YOU LOSE --" -- AT SOME POINT, YOU HAVE TO CONFRONT WHAT KIND OF FORUM THIS IS, RIGHT? >> YEAH, YOU DO, AND A LOT OF THIS STARTS OUT IN FAVOR OF A PRESIDENT, AND THIS ONE, FOR THE FIRST TIME, MANAGED TO DO IT IN THE WAY MOST LIKELY TO LET HIM LOOSE A CASE, BUT IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THAT WAY. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT HAVE TO HAVE PRESS CONFERENCES. IT SEEMS TO ME CLEAR THAT HE COULD DO THAT. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS, EVEN UNDER A BROAD FIRST AMENDMENT READINGS, A GREAT DEAL OF AUTHORITY OVER. HE DOES NOT HAVE TO HAVE PRESS CONFERENCES, HE CAN LEAK TO WHOEVER HE WANTS, HE CAN CALL ON WHOEVER HE WANTS, AND HE, THEY, CAN MAKE RULES, WHICH LIMIT THE QUESTIONS, AS THEY APPEAR TO HAVE, TO LIMIT THE QUESTION TO ONE PER PERSON, THEY CAN MAKE A RULE, NO FOLLOW-UPS. THE REASON THAT IN THE TIME AFTER THE PROMULGATION AND RELEASE OF THESE RULES THAT THERE ARE STILL FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS OF SARAH SANDERS, FOR THE MOST PART, IS THAT THERE IS NO OBJECTION TO THEM. SO THIS IS NOT -- THE FIRST AMENDMENT DOES NOT, IN A CIRCUMSTANCE LIKE THIS, PROVIDE ANYTHING LIKE A FULL OPEN DOOR. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL ARE NOT INVITED. IT IS MEMBERS OF THE PRESS WHO ARE. AND THE PRIMARY WAY THAT THE PUBLIC WILL GET INFORMED IS THAT IF THE PRESIDENT SUFFICIENTLY ABUSED HIS OR HER POWER, JOURNALISTS WILL STOP COMING. SUPPOSE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE PRESIDENT ONLY CALLED ON A FEW CONSERVATIVE JOURNALISTS. THERE WOULD BE A PRESS REVOLT, AND I DO NOT BELIEVE IT WOULD TAKE LONG BEFORE THE LARGER ENTITIES WOULD SAY AND TRY TO LIVE BY WHAT THEY ARE SAYING. "WE ...'
